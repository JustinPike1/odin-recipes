    <h1>Sous Vide Carnitas</h1>
        <img src="../images/svc.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These incredibly moist, melt-in-your-mouth carnitas are infused with warm 
            spices and become the base for a variety of dishes. My favorite way to 
            eat these is inside corn tortillas, topped with cilantro and onion, 
            but it's also delicious in quesadillas, posole, nachos, or atop a salad! 
            For added flavor, rub the seasonings on the pork the night before.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>2 teaspoons granulated garlic</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
                <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1 (4 pound) boneless pork butt</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chicken soup base (such as Better than Bouillon)</li>
                <li>1 medium orange, sliced</li>
                <li>3 large bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Fill a large pot with water and place a sous vide immersion cooker 
                    into the water. Set temperature to 165 degrees F (74 degrees C) 
                    according to manufacturer's directions.</li>
                <li>Combine granulated garlic, cumin, salt, oregano, coriander, and 
                    black pepper in a small bowl.</li>
                <li>Cut pork butt into 2 chunks and rub with soup base. Sprinkle with 
                    spice mixture and rub until evenly distributed. Place pork into a 
                    large vacuum bag. Add orange slices and bay leaves throughout the 
                    bag. Seal using a vacuum sealer.</li>
                <li>Place bag into the water and set timer for 24 hours, turning bag 
                    over halfway through. When done, remove pork to a platter, 
                    reserving some or all of the juices.</li>
                <li>To crisp up carnitas, heat vegetable oil in a large cast iron 
                    skillet over high heat until smoking. Add shredded pork and fry 
                    until edges are browned and crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Drizzle with 
                    reserved juices, if desired. Alternately, you may crisp under an 
                    oven broiler for 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
            </ol>
